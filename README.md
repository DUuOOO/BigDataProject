# BigDataProject
These are the source codes of solutions for big data that I utilize when encountering difficulties in my projects.

1. ReadBigDataFile.py shows way of reading large file without strict format. 
2. ReadBigIsonFile.py shows way of reading large json file.
3. Batch_process.py shows way of reading large json file and transporting data to es by batch.
